## Using Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following are installed and available on your system:

* **Docker** or **Docker Desktop -**  (Docker Version - 20.10.x and above)
* Open ports: **8080**, **8081**, **3000**, **5432 -** Ensure that the following ports are not in use:

### 1.1 Setup with Docker Compose

1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This command will pull and download the necessary containers, and the client will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. Default Credentials for client app - **Username**: dev@breezeware.net **Password**: breeze123 or Signup.
4. Application Port
   * **Backend Server** - 8081
   * **Frontend Client -** 3000
   * **Auth Server -** 8080

### 1.2 If Docker not installed - Docker Installation

#### **For Docker on Linux:**

1. Update your packages:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. Install Docker using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```
3. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

#### **For Docker Desktop on Mac/Windows:**

1. Download and install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Follow the installation instructions and start Docker Desktop.

### 1.3 Troubleshooting

#### Checking and Managing Active Ports

Ensure that the following ports are not in use:

* **8080**
* **8081**
* **3000**
* **5432**

If any of these ports are active, you need to free them by killing the respective processes. You can check for active ports using:

```bash
lsof -i :<port_number>
```

To kill a process on a specific port:

```bash
kill -9 <process_id>
```

#### If you encounter file permission issues, use the following command:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER postgres-data/
```

#### If this doesn‚Äôt resolve the issue, try:

* Resetting changes with Git:

  ```bash
  git checkout .
  ```
* Deleting the project and re-cloning it.

#### If you encounter Error response from daemon: pull access denied for public.ecr.aws, use the following command:

```bash
docker logout public.ecr.aws
```

## Additional Notes

* Always verify that no other processes are using ports **8080**, **8081**, **3000**, or **5432** before running the services.
* If you encounter issues with ports, repeat the process to kill active ports as mentioned above.

This completes the setup for the Dynamo Form Builder Template. If further issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section or restart from the initial steps.

# Overview

## Getting Started

The **Dynamo Framework** is a comprehensive, modular framework that simplifies the development of large-scale enterprise applications. Built using Java and Spring Boot, Dynamo integrates a range of essential libraries for different functionalities such as AI integration, authentication, AWS services, batch processing, CSV handling, and more. Each library is designed to serve a distinct purpose, offering flexibility and scalability to the application development process.

### Libraries Included

* **dynamo-ai**: Leverages OpenAI and Spring AI for intelligent capabilities.
* **dynamo-auth**: Supports FusionAuth and Active Directory for secure authentication management.
* **dynamo-aws**: Simplifies AWS services integration like SNS, S3, DynamoDB.
* **dynamo-batch**: Manages batch operations with ease.
* **dynamo-csv**: Facilitates CSV parsing and generation using OpenCSV.
* **dynamo-form-builder**: Uses Jackson to easily manage form data.
* **dynamo-generics-crud**: Provides a CRUD operation layer with JPA and QueryDSL.
* **dynamo-iac**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) integration with AWS CDK.
* **dynamo-image**: Image processing via ImgScalr.
* **dynamo-logging**: Centralized logging with Log4j2.
* **dynamo-push-notification**: Manages to push notifications via AWS SNS.
* **dynamo-pages**: Uses CommonMark for dynamic page generation and markdown handling.
* **dynamo-sdk-lib-bom**: Ensures consistent version management for all functional libraries.
* **dynamo-user-management**: Provides user management capabilities using AWS Cognito.
* **dynamo-utils**: Utility library including Commons Text, Hibernate Validator, and custom exceptions.
* **dynamo-workflow**: Integrates Camunda BPM for workflow management with Spring Boot.

## Using Dynamo

### Prerequisites

* **Java**: 17+
* **Maven**: 3.x+
* **Spring Boot**: 3.2.x
* **AWS**: For AWS-related modules
* **PostgreSQL**: (Optional) For persistence modules

### Dependencies

To use any of the Dynamo libraries, include them in your `pom.xml` as follows:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.breezeware.dynamo</groupId>
    <artifactId>dynamo-{module}</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
Replace {module} with the desired module name, such as dynamo-ai, dynamo-aws, etc and version.

Example:

<dependency>
    <groupId>net.breezeware.dynamo</groupId>
    <artifactId>dynamo-auth</artifactId>
    <version>1.44.0</version>
</dependency>
```


### Configuration

Each module may require specific configurations. Please refer to the individual module documentation for detailed setup instructions.

## Building From Source

## Module: dynamo-workflow

### Module Introduction

The Dynamo workflow is designed to handle specific tasks in the overall process management system.

### Vocabulary/Terminology

- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Objects responsible for accessing and managing data from the database.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: Objects that carry data between processes.
- **Entity**: An object representing a domain model, usually persisted in a database.
- **Service**: A layer responsible for business logic and operations.
- **Task Manager**: Component responsible for managing tasks within a process workflow

### Technologies/3rd Party Libraries

- **Camunda BPM**: For workflow and decision automation.
- **Spring Boot**: Application framework for building the service layer.
- **Hibernate**: ORM tool for database interactions.

###  Sample Use Cases Implemented/That Could Be Implemented
- **CamundaProcessManager**: Provides common functionality using Camunda.
- **Entity Generator**: The service parse and save the JSON and save the JSON in ProcessDomainEntity
- **ProcessService**: Provides concrete methods and abstract methods . 

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Breezeware-OS/dynamo.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the module directory**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/dynamo-sdk-lib/dynamo-workflow
   ```
3. **Build the module**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
